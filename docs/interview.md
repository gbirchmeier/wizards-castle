# The Story of The Wizard's Castle

*Wed, 06/27/2007 - 12:23pm — Matt Barton*

One of the great things about writing a book is that you
get to hear so many interesting stories. One of the best
I've heard so far involves a very, very early game for the
Exidy Sorcerer named
[The Wizard's Castle](http://www.mobygames.com/game/wizards-castle).
Although programmed by Joe Power a few years earlier (in the
mid 1970s), the game wasn't officially released until 1980,
when it was printed as source code in Recreational Computing
magazine. It's been ported to several other platforms (by
Power and others). Eventually it was played by Derell L.,
who prefers to go by his nickname "Derelict." Derelict
converted the game for Windows and added sprite-based
graphics (you can download it 
[here](http://home.comcast.net/~derelict/winwiz.html)).
Anyway, I had the chance to talk to both Joe and Derelict
about their games, and have decided to print them here for
your enjoyment! Note that I haven't edited these
interviews--I didn't have to!

First, Joe:

> The year was 1975. I was a freshman at Michigan State
> University and I tagged along with some friends going to the
> Windycon science fiction convention in Chicago. Someone on
> the con committee had arranged to have some remote terminals
> tied into some college's time-share system upon which you
> could run a primitive version of Star Trek and another, very
> similar game with a fantasy motif (called HOBBIT). These
> were printing terminals, not CRTs (the ADM-3a was still
> about a year and a half away at that point.)
> 
> I found the game intriguing and, when someone managed to
> break the game I managed to get a listing of it while trying
> to restart it.
> 
> Up to that point I'd only learned FORTRAN IV in a batch
> processing environment and the program was written in a
> dialect of HP BASIC (1 letter variable names, 1-dimensional
> arrays only, if statements could only branch, etc.) Even so,
> I could figure out enough of the code to realize that
> whoever had written it must have simply sat down at a
> terminal and started banging away - it was a horrible pile
> of spaghetti code.
> 
> That summer I happened to be near a Radio Shack that sold
> the TRS-80s which had just come out. The owner had a model 1
> (4K of RAM, integer basic, 300baud cassette tape storage)
> available for demonstration / experimentation. I bought a
> book on TRS-80 Basic and taught myself enough to write my
> own version of HOBBIT. It was a much cleaner version of the
> code and played roughly the same as the one I'd played.
> Several of the other nerds hanging out at the store that
> summer played it a lot and enjoyed it and the store owner
> often used it to show off what could be done with even the
> entry-level machine. I, however, wasn't satisfied with it.
> 
> The problem, for me, was that there simply weren't enough
> ways to interact with the program and it became
> repetitive - wander around, kill monsters, get treasures, lather,
> rinse, repeat. By then I was playing Dungeons & Dragons (the
> original 3 book set and the Greyhawk supplement) so I was
> used to a much richer game experience.
> 
> I decided to re-write the game from scratch. I thought about
> what extra features I would put in the game and ended up
> with everything you see in Wizard's Castle plus one big
> section that I pulled from the final version (originally,
> you could buy a shovel from a merchant and use it to bury
> some or all of your possessions. Later you could dig them
> up. There were monsters that stole things from you to give
> you a reason to do this. The amount of code needed to
> implement this was so large I decided it wasn't cost
> effective and eliminated it.)
> 
> Michigan State was still almost entirely a batch-only
> environment (heck, there were punch card vending machines in
> the computer center!) and any microcomputer of the time
> large enough to run what I had in mind cost a small fortune
> and had to be assembled by the user. As a consequence, I
> decided to write the program in a pascal/basic/english
> hybrid pseudo-code figuring I'd convert it to whatever
> specific language I would eventually have access to.
> 
> Long about then a few fellows got together and opened up a
> computer store in East Lansing. At the time there were still
> not that many microcomputers for sale and, like so many of
> the early computer stores, New Dimensions in Computing sold
> more magazines (Byte, Kilobaud, Creative Computing, etc.)
> and books than anything else. They didn't have enough
> capitalization to satisfy Apple's requirements to be an
> authorized dealer, but they did have Northstar systems for
> small businesses and the Exidy Sorcerer for home use.
> 
> I was friends with a couple of the owners and they didn't
> mind if I played with their 16K demo machine when it wasn't
> in use. (By the way, the "Kingdom of N'dic" was a nod to
> them for their kindness.)
> 
> I converted my pseudo-code into Sorcerer Basic (which was
> the cheaper version of Microsoft's flagship product at that
> time) and started typing it in. Naturally I discovered that
> the program wouldn't fit in the machine! I threw out all the
> comments, looked for common code fragments I could turn into
> ugly subroutines, tightened up the code overall and - most
> significantly - I used the Sorcerer's user-definable
> character memory instead of a Basic array to hold the castle
> array.
> 
> (The Exidy Sorcerer's characters were 8x8 bits and the top
> 128 character shape definitions were stored in a specific
> RAM location. This made the Sorcerer nearly ideal for
> displaying foreign character sets and - because changing the
> shape definition of a character changed EVERY instance of
> that character on the screen in a single refresh - made it a
> natural for games like Space Invaders, Pacman, etc. Of
> course, if you didn't happen to use any user-definable
> characters then the memory was available for other purposes.
> This fact will become important in a bit.)
> 
> Eventually the guys took pity on me and increased the memory
> in the demo model to 24K. Between that and my code squeezing
> Wizard's Castle finally fit. I corrected a few obvious flaws
> and then sat back and watched others play it, making notes
> and fixing bugs as needed. I continued to compress the code
> because I really wanted it to fit in 16K (which was the
> standard amount of memory the Sorcerer came with.)
> 
> I'm still somewhat amazed the store owners didn't banish the
> program (and me) as they seemed to get a steady stream of
> people wanting to play it (though I know of at least two
> systems sold because kids who'd been playing it dragged
> their parents in!)
> 
> Right about the time I finished polishing the code there was
> an announcement in Kilobaud magazine that they were starting
> up a software division and were actively seeking programs
> for the Exidy Sorcerer. Seeing visions of megabucks dancing
> before my eyes, I decided to submit Wizard's Castle but I
> needed to write documentation for it. I did this and sent
> both program and user manual in and waited to hear back from
> them.
> 
> Before too long I got a call indicating they really wanted
> to sell my program. We went over a few things and one of the
> questions they asked was "could I put any user-defined
> graphics in it?" as they had heard that this was one of the
> big features of the Sorcerer. I explained that in order to
> make the program fit in 16K I had to use the graphics memory
> for another purpose. "No problem" they said. "We really want
> to get it out by Christmas." A contract soon arrived and I
> thought all was well.
> 
> Days turned into weeks turned into a couple months and I'd
> heard nothing from them. Finally I was able to get through
> to the person who'd taken over for the person who'd replaced
> the person with whom I'd talked. He looked at my file and
> told me there was a hold on doing anything with the program
> until they found out if I could put any user-defined
> graphics in. Grrrr... I explained that I'd answered that
> question and did so again.
> 
> By then, of course, it was too late to make the Christmas
> season and a few months afterwards it became clear that they
> were getting out of the Sorcerer market altogether. We
> mutually revoked the contract. Although I wasn't all that
> devastated I wasn't going to rake in the big bucks from it,
> it seemed a shame to just let Wizard's Castle die and when
> Recreational Computing magazine announced they were going to
> do a fantasy game issue I submitted a listing and the
> documentation I'd written. They printed it in their
> July/August 1980 issue. (There were a couple other articles with comparably sized programs listed as
> well.)
> 
> As I mentioned in the article, by then the program had been
> ported to several other systems. A small local software

> You asked about the gaming context in which I wrote Wizard's

Now, Derelict!
