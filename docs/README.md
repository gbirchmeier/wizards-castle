# wizards-castle documentation


* [castle.txt](castle.txt) - What is displayed when you run `wizards-castle --manual`.
  Aside from the obvious addition about my Ruby port, this is exactly what was distributed
  with J.F. Stetson's version.
* [WIZARD.BAS](WIZARD.BAS) - original J.F. Stetson source (or, the best one I could find)

* [original-article.pdf](original-article.pdf) - This is a scan of the original article
  from *Recreational Computing* magazine (July 1980) where *Wizard's Castle* first premiered.
  `castle.txt` is adapted from this.
* [original-source.pdf](original-code.pdf) - The source code from that same article.
  (This is the original Joseph R. Powers source, not the later J.F. Stetson version
  that the Ruby port is based on.)
