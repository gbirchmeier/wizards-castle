# wizards-castle
A Ruby port of the classic BASIC game "Wizard's Castle"

Feature complete.  I'm still testing, and I still need to write some docs and command-line options.

Right now you can git-clone the repo and run with

    ruby -Ilib ./bin/wizards-castle

My dev environment is Ruby 2.1, but it'll probably work in any 2.x.
