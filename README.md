# wizards-castle
A Ruby port of the classic BASIC game "Wizard's Castle".

Current version is 0.0.2.  Needs more testing and also some docs and command-line options.

To play, install the `wizards-castle` gem and then run `wizards-castle`.

It should work fine in any 2.x Ruby.  It has no dependencies on external gems.

## Running the latest version off of this Git repo
git-clone the repo and run with

    ruby -Ilib ./bin/wizards-castle

My dev environment is Ruby 2.1, but it'll probably work in any 2.x.

I'm not really looking for contributors right now.

## Bugs!
