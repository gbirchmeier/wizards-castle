# wizards-castle
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/wizards-castle.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/wizards-castle)

A Ruby port of the classic BASIC game "Wizard's Castle".

Version 1.0 is within striking distance.  Just some doc stuff, mostly.

To play, install the `wizards-castle` gem and then run `wizards-castle`.

It should work fine in any 2.x Ruby.  It has no dependencies on external gems.

## Running the latest version off of this Git repo
git-clone the repo and run with

    ruby -Ilib ./bin/wizards-castle

As mentioned above, any Ruby 2.x version should work.

I'm not really looking for contributors right now.

## Bugs!

If you see a crash, please:
* copy the most recent 100+ lines of your game
* note the version you are running

then report those via
* [Github issue](https://github.com/gbirchmeier/wizards-castle/issues)
* Twitter [@GrantBirchmeier](https://twitter.com/GrantBirchmeier)
* email to the address you'll find at http://grantb.net

**Note:** Please do not report grammar errors.  This is a faithful port of
the original game, and the grammar errors are probably authentically preserved.
